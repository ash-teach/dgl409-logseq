- # Content
	- ## Class welcome
		- Take temperature of class - how are they feeling beyond this course?
		- Course update - rubrics and assignment descriptions not yet complete, Brightspace shell not yet complete
	- ## Elevator pitch presentations
		- Ask what kind of feedback they want on their biographies and on the board, write a set of things to listen for. Make sure these are covered:
			- Length - should be 30 seconds to 2 minutes
			- Too generic? How can they make it more specific to them?
			- Too ChatGPT? How can they rewrite it so that it sounds human?
			- Too corporate? How do they make it personal, relatable? How do they fit with the company culture that they want to be a part of?
			- Does it relate to their project choice?
		- Students present 2-3 minutes.
			- Tell the class what they are thinking about doing for their project.
			- Read their bio
		- Peer + instructor feedback.
	- ## Project idea roundtable
		- Some of you have ideas, some of you don't...
		- Have you reviewed projects on [LearnDigital.dev](https://learndigital.dev/)?
		- Brainstorming framework:
			- Identify the tools/technologies that you intend to work with / could work with
			- Mindmap *at least* one of the following:
				- Consider *past*: incomplete projects, projects to be improved, projects left by the wayside
				- Consider *friction*: what product/service do you wish *you* had access to?
				- Consider *career*: what project would be most helpful to your future career?
		- Match and cull
		- Class feedback - What would be most valuable?
		- Class presentations - Describe one project, explain *why* it is a valuable project (to you? to who?) and how strongly you feel about it.
