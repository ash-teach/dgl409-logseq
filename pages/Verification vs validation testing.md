## Verification
	- "Are we building the product right?"
	- Checking if the product complies with requirements.
	- Happens during development (e.g., code review, static analysis).
	- Common techniques:
		- **Unit testing**: Testing individual functions or pieces of code.
		- **Code walkthroughs**: Reviewing the logic step-by-step.
		- **Integration testing**: Ensuring multiple components work together.
	- Tools for Verification:
		- **Mocha/Chai** (for JavaScript testing).
		- **Jest** (for React and other frameworks).
		- **Selenium** (for automated testing).
- ## Validation
	- "Are we building the right product?"
	- Ensures the product fulfills its intended purpose for the user.
	- Happens after development or feature completion (e.g., usability testing).
	- Common techniques:
		- **User acceptance testing** (UAT): Real users test the product to validate its usability.
		- **Usability testing**: Observing users as they interact with the product.
		- **Beta testing**: Releasing a beta version for external testing and feedback.
- ## Examples of Verification & Validation
	- **Verification**:
		- Security -
		- Credit card validation
		- Layout of a page
		- Responsiveness
		- Scalability - good project structure, integration testing,
		- Form validation - any kind of user input
		-
	- **Validation**:
		- Accessibility
		- Perfomance
		- SEO
- ## How to Apply Verification and Validation in Your Capstone
	- Regularly run unit tests during feature development.
	- Once a feature is complete, validate by testing it with peers or external users.
	- Incorporate peer code reviews as a method of verification.
- ## Activity
	- *Hands on verification and validation testing*
	- Individual and group work.
	- Examines a project where a web product needs verification and validation.
	- Identify verification steps and two validation steps and opportunities.
