## What is Quality Assurance (QA)?
	- Systematic process to ensure products meet specified requirements.
	- Involves identifying defects early in the development cycle.
	- Balances between user needs, technical requirements, and business goals.
	- Continuous process throughout development—iterative improvements.
- ## Importance of QA in Web & App Development
	- Prevents costly errors from reaching users.
	- Enhances product usability and performance.
	- Helps maintain consistency, stability, and user trust.
	- Directly tied to user experience and customer satisfaction.
- ## Why is QA Relevant Now in Your Capstone?
	- You’ve built an MVP, now polish and ensure reliability.
	- Effective QA can improve the marketability and success of your project.
	- QA saves time and resources when applied regularly, rather than after final development.
- ## QA is Not Just Testing
	- Planning for QA begins with the design.
	- Testing is part of QA but so is documentation, code review, user feedback.
	- QA involves verification (are we building the product right?) and validation (are we building the right product?).
- ## Activity
	- **Think-Pair-Share**
	- Reflect for 2 minutes on any QA challenges you've faced in previous projects or current capstone development.
	- Pair with a peer to discuss challenges (3 minutes).
	- Share insights as a class (5 minutes).
