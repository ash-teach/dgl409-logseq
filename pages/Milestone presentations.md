# Description
	- Each milestone includes a class presentation to communicate work completed. Presentations become increasingly more formal and structured as the semester progresses, with initial presentations being treated more like a workshop / conversation, and later presentations being treated more like client presentations and critiques.
- # Requirements
	- The student demonstrates knowledge of effective presentation techniques, including use of presentation materials, appropriate speech and body language.
	- The student demonstrates knowledge of effective documentation techniques by capturing and presenting critical aspects of product development tasks up to the milestone deadline.
	- The student demonstrates self-knowledge by critically reflecting on their product development practice.
	- The student demonstrates strategic thinking in the context of the development of their product by critically analyzing their process and activities and identifying successes and mitigating potential risks.
- # Checklist
	- Presentation materials
		- Slidedeck
		- Script (should not be read, and need not be memorized, but demonstrates forethought and planning)
		- Anticipated questions
	- 15-minute presentation
		- Project summary (elevator pitch?)
		- Work completed to date
		- Status of project
		- Demonstration (depending on milestone...)
		- Work to be completed
		- Risks to be mitigated
- # Notes
	- Clarify distinction between reflection criteria and strategic thinking criteria.
	- Anticipate questions should be used with more intention. Students should identify valid questions and use these to improve presentation (i.e. add more content, etc)
	- No student should struggle to fill 15 minutes if appropriate questions are identified
	- Presentations can remain informal (up til final) and can be thought of as continuations - adding to same PPT is fine
	- Model better documentation procedures, appropriate methods of reflection, and criteria for risks (they must be actual risks - not just tasks that are incomplete - and should be risks associated with the capstone project - not post-capstone)
	- Make sure student include appropriate time for presentation development in their timeline/budget - include in Gantt chart template and as example of granular task.
