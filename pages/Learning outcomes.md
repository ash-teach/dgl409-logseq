	- ## Mapping
		- ### [[Capstone - Proposal]]
			- [[LO1]] - (Design) [[Metacognitive knowledge]] - specifically strategic, contextual and conditional knowledge.
			- [[LO2]] - [[Conceptual knowledge]] - students aren't prepared to develop their own well-formed learning objectives. This is a faculty supported task. Outcomes should provide an opportunity for knowledge synthesis.
			- [[LO3]] - [[Procedural knowledge]] - students apply skills related to design, user research and project management to produce a complete project proposal.
		- ### [[Capstone - MVP]]
			- [[LO1]] - (Manage) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students understand techniques and methods of project management.
			- [[LO3]] - (Apply) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students have subject specific skills that are used to produce elements of the final product.
			- [[LO4]] - (Produce... portfolio project) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students demonstrate an ability to produce meaningful project documentation using appropriate tools.
		- ### [[Capstone - Feature complete]]
			- [[LO1]] - (Manage) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students understand techniques and methods of project management.
			- [[LO3]] - (Apply) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students have subject specific skills that are used to produce elements of the final product.
			- [[LO3]] - (Synthesize) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students demonstrate a critical ability to choose appropriate methods used to produce elements of the final project.
			- [[LO4]] - (Produce... portfolio project) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students demonstrate an ability to produce meaningful project documentation using appropriate tools.
		- ### [[Capstone - Final]]
			- [[LO1]] - (Manage) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students understand techniques and methods of project management.
			- [[LO3]] - (Apply) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students have subject specific skills that are used to produce elements of the final product.
			- [[LO3]] - (Synthesize) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students demonstrate a critical ability to choose appropriate methods used to produce elements of the final project.
			- [[LO4]] - (Produce... portfolio project) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students demonstrate an ability to produce meaningful project documentation using appropriate tools.
		- ### [[Milestone presentations]]
			- [[LO1]] - (Manage) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students understand techniques and methods of project management.
			- [[LO3]] - (Apply) [[Metacognitive knowledge]] - students demonstrate self-knowledge through critical reflection on processes. (Early stage presentations).
			- [[LO3]] - (Synthesize) [[Metacognitive knowledge]] - students demonstrate strategic knowledge through critical reflection on processes and opportunities leading to synthesis activities. (Building to this across all four presentations).
			- [[LO4]] - (Produce... process documentation) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students demonstrate knowledge of techniques and methods for producing effective presentation.
		- ### [[Milestone presentation reports]]
			- [[LO1]] - (Manage) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students understand techniques and methods of project management.
			- [[LO3]] - (Synthesize) [[Metacognitive knowledge]] - students demonstrate contextual and self-knowledge through critical reflection on peer and instructor presentation feedback. (Building to this across all four presentations reports).
			- [[LO4]] - (Produce... process documentation) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students demonstrate knowledge of techniques and methods for producing effective documentation.
		- ### [[Capstone - Case Study]]
			- [[LO1]] - (Manage) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students understand techniques and methods of project management.
			- [[LO2]] - [[Metacognitive knowledge]] - students demonstrate self-knowledge by critiquing their efforts (successes or failures) towards the achievement of personal learning objectives.
			- [[LO4]] - (Produce... process documentation) [[Procedural knowledge]] - students demonstrate knowledge of techniques and methods for producing effective presentation.
	- ## Key considerations
		- Synthesis - demonstrate how and where learning from individual courses has influenced development
		- Manage - demonstrate through Toggl
		- LO2 - complete by proposal time frame, since LOs must be established
		- LO4 - documentation with each milestone
		- GitHub
			- README.md must be fully developed
			- Demonstrate progress through commit (tied to tasks / issues)
			- Must be hosted on class organization
- # Note for future consideration
	- Outcomes are too complex. Should be remapped to single verb outcomes with clearer context
	- Team initiatives outcome necessary?
	- There maybe isn't enough in the LOs to encourage knowledge synthesis from *new* external sources (i.e. we should encourage regular critical thought and reflection, which can be achieved through readings, videos, homework)
