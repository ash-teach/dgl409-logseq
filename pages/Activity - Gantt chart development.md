# Description
	- Choose the tasks to include in the Gantt chart. Ensure they are at a granular enough level that the chart is meaningful, but not so detailed that the chart is easily bogged down.
	- Agile processes (i.e. scrum, kanban) can handle the more granular tasks.
	- The Gantt chart helps to identify the critical path - the minimum timeline necessary to achieve a completed project.
- # Process
	- Identify all necessary tasks to be included.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Break down chart into relevant categories, perhaps by team role or function.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- List tasks per category in dependency order, with early tasks listed first.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Add time estimates to each task.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Arrange time estimates such that they are well-balanced over the duration of the project. 
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Note dependencies between tasks.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Identify critical path by underlining the most critical task at each time step.
