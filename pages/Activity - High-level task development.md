# Description
	- Identify all high-level tasks that serve to identify critical steps needed to complete the project. These steps identify potential blockers, but do not delve deeply into technical details and tasks.
	- High-level tasks are used to develop a Gantt chart and critical path.
	- High-level tasks are used to identify granular tasks for technical work.
- # Process
	- Produce a list of all high-level tasks - avoid becoming too granular, but provide best-guess time estimates.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- On the order of 20 or so tasks (think about multi-hour or day length tasks)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Focus on blockers - those things that you can't progress without completing
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- 409 assignments count as required tasks!
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Produce a network graph for all high-level tasks - this helps to identify dependencies. Use software that allows for easy network management, or go lo-fi with post-it notes.
