## Why Performance Matters
	- Impacts first impressions (users expect fast-loading websites).
	- Affects SEO ranking and overall user experience.
	- Faster websites often have lower bounce rates and higher user engagement.
	- Especially important for mobile users on slower connections.
- ## Key Performance Metrics
	- **First Contentful Paint** (FCP): Time until first text/image appears.
	- **Time to Interactive** (TTI): Time until the page becomes fully interactive.
	- **Largest Contentful Paint** (LCP): Time until the largest visible content appears.
	- **Cumulative Layout Shift** (CLS): Measures unexpected layout shifts during page load.
- ## Common Performance Bottlenecks
- ## Performance Testing Tools
	- **Lighthouse**: Provides performance metrics with recommendations.
	- **Chrome DevTools** (Performance tab): Analyzes load times, JavaScript execution, and rendering speed.
	- **WebPageTest**: Advanced performance analysis with waterfall diagrams.
- ## How to Run a Performance Test
	- Step 1: Open Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse → Run performance audit.
	- Step 2: Analyze the report, focusing on FCP, LCP, and CLS.
	- Step 3: Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize (e.g., compress images, minify JavaScript).
	- Step 4: Re-test to see the impact of optimizations.
- ## Activity
	- *Hands-On Performance Test*
	- Run performance tests using Lighthouse on a small demo project.
	- Group discussion of common issues that impact performance.
