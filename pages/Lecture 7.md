- # Learning outcomes
	- ## Course level
		- | Learning outcome | Level | Activity |
		  | design and manage a self-directed project through the stages of ~~discovery~~, planning, production, deployment and presentation | beginning | PM methodologies |
		  | ~~research and prepare personal learning objectives for self-directed study related to the student’s preferred specialty~~ |  |  |
		  | synthesize and apply skills and knowledge acquired to date in the completion of a capstone project | beginning | MVP workshop |
	- ## Lecture outcomes
		- | Activity | Outcome | Maps to... |
		  | PM methodologies challenges | Compare and contrast PM methodologies to identify pros and cons in the context of a specific software development project | Following PM best practices will support project planning and task scheduling ([[LO1]]) |
		  | MVP requirements workshop | Identify key features of an MVP | Identifying key MVP features will help us to better define MVP submission requirement, which in turn will support project planning and task scheduling ([[LO1]]) |
		- **Case study**: Recall the context of project management concerns specific to video game development; explain how lessons learned can apply to capstone project. ([[LO1]])
