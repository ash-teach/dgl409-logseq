# Description
	- Write granular tasks that identify specific actions to be taken, especially for more technical tasks.
- # Process
	- SMART tasks:
		- **Specific** - Could someone else with equivalent knowledge be expected to complete this task?
		- **Measurable** - Avoid quality - focus on the requirements defined by previous tasks, or by the project.
		- **Achievable** - Is it specific, measurable and time-bound - and can it be completed within the bounds of the project / course.
		- **Relevant** - Ask yourself this question everytime you engage with a new task: Is it still relevant?
		- **Time-bound** - Draw a line in the sand - write the best time estimates you can with the knowledge you have.
